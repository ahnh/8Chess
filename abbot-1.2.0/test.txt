// Lines that start with two slashes or?
-- two dashes are considered comments 
/* C-style comments can end on the same line like this */ 
/* A "block" comment may continue across?
lines like this, as long as you started the first 
line with the slash-star */ 
But if you start the line with code you 
can't continue across lines /* by commenting 
??????????????????????????????? at the end of a line 
??????????????????????????????? like this */ 
Because you should // use trailing comments 
                   // like this 
                   // instead 

/* Similarly, don't put code 
you want counted */ after a close block comment like this

We can't deal with nested block comments -- the first star-slash will 
terminate the block (as do most compilers). 

 /* 
 Since there must be 4 or more non-blank characters on the 
 line to be counted, the above 
 line won't count (even if you are counting comments). 
 Nor will the following:

 /**
  * Won't count the above line opening Javadoc style block comments
